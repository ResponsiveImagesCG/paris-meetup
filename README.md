## About  
The purpose of the meetup is to discuss the proposed solutions (see below), 
assess the obstacles to their implementations, and build momentum behind the problem space. 
A little more detail:

For the last couple of years, various folks have been working towards finding a way to bring 
responsive images to the Web, with significant interest from Web developers. Although we now 
have 3 proposals on the table (
[srcset](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/srcset/w3c-srcset/),
[`picture` element](http://picture.responsiveimages.org )
and [client hints](https://github.com/igrigorik/http-client-hints)), we've had 
trouble getting sufficient momentum behind browser implementations that would let the market 
decide which solutions fulfills the [use cases](http://usecases.responsiveimages.org) 
most effectively.

In the mean time, developers are makig due with custom pollyfills that often prevent 
browsers from loading the image resources until after the DOM was (at least partially) loaded 
and Javascript has run. This directly hinders the performance work browser engineers have done 
over the years to optimize resource loading, and get requests on the wire as soon as possible ( 
according to their priority). That leaves developers with the dilemma: "Do we stall the image load?, 
or download unnecessary image data which will slow down the overall load time and inflate 
the user's bills?"

## Proposed agenda
1. Developer's perspectives
  * Overview of the problem - Mat Marquis (remote presentation) 
  * BBC's approach to responsive images - Mark McDonnell
  * Akamai's approach to responsive images - Guy Podjarny
2. Introduction to each of the proposed solutions:
  * The srcset attribute - Ted O'Connor
  * The picture element - Marcos CÃ¡ceres
  * Client Hints - Boris Smus or Ilya Grigorik
  * New image format? - Yoav Weiss 
3. Implementors feedback on the solutions
  * [DPR switching](http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#resolution-switching) - relatively easy.
  * [Viewport switching](http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#resolution-switching) - harder.
  * [Art direction](http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#art-direction) - hardest.
4. Overlap among solutions
  * [lazylaod and postpone](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourcePriorities/Overview.html). 
5. Next steps

Lunch @ ~12:30 - provided by Mozilla. Resume at 1:30pm.
